## FES+VFT Prototype

# Purpose

This is the first initial prototype of the FES+VFT (Functional Electrical Stimulation and Visual Feedback Training) portable system. This system is designed for use with a Wii Balance Board in Unity, replacing the original lab based system, which utilized an AMTI forceplate and LabView.

# Libraries used

This project utilizes the WiiBuddy Asset from the Unity Asset store. Since it's a paid asset, its files cannot be included in the project files. The asset will need to be bought from the Unity asset stored and installed before the project can work.

This project utilizes the InTheHand 32feet.NET library distributed under the MIT license for handling bluetooth connections and connecting to the Wii Balance Board.
