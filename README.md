# FES-VFT-Prototype

This is the first initial prototype of the FES+VFT portable system. This system will be used with a Wii Balance Board and Unity, replacing the AMTI forceplate and LabView.

Currently utilizes the WiiBuddy Asset from the Unity Asset store. Since it's a paid asset, its files cannot be included in the project files.
